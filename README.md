### What I have learned for Tensorflow Certificate Exam (You can use this as a checklist for preparation): 

Resources: Daniel Bourke


#### **(1) Tensorflow Basics**
- Build and train neural network models using TensorFlow 2.x

- Build, compile and train machine learning (ML) models using TensorFlow.

- Preprocess data to get it ready for use in a model.
- Use models to predict results.

- Build sequential models with multiple layers.

- Build and train models for binary classification.

- Build and train models for multi-class categorization.

- Plot loss and accuracy of a trained model.

- Identify strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

- Use pretrained models (transfer learning).

- Extract features from pre-trained models.

- Ensure that inputs to a model are in the correct shape.

- Ensure that you can match test data to the input shape of a neural network.

- Ensure you can match output data of a neural network to specified input shape for test data.

- Understand batch loading of data.

- Use callbacks to trigger the end of training cycles.

- Use datasets from different sources.

- Use datasets in different formats, including json and csv.

- Use datasets from tf.data.datasets.


#### **(2) Image classification**

- Define Convolutional neural networks with Conv2D and pooling layers.

- Build and train models to process real-world image datasets.

- Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network.

- Use real-world images in different shapes and sizes.

- Use image augmentation to prevent overfitting.

- Use ImageDataGenerator.

- Understand how ImageDataGenerator labels images based on the directory structure.


#### **(3) Natural language processing (NLP)**
- Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

- Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.

- Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary categorization

- Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using multi-class categorization

- Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model.

- Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.

- Add RNN layers to your model.

- Use RNNS, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.

- Train LSTMs on existing text to generate text (such as songs and poetry)


#### **(4) Time series, sequences and predictions**

- Train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models.

- Prepare data for time series learning.

- Understand Mean Average Error (MAE) and how it can be used to evaluate accuracy of sequence models.

- Use RNNs and CNNs for time series, sequence and forecasting models.

- Identify when to use trailing versus centred windows.

- TensorFlow Certificate Candidate Handbook 3

- Use TensorFlow for forecasting.

- Prepare features and labels.

- Identify and compensate for sequence bias.

- Adjust the learning rate dynamically in time series, sequence and prediction models.
